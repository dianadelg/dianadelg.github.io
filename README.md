We are out here looking prettier!

messing around with a parallax website. Need to add skills, experience, (basically break down resume.)


Also maybe see if there is a way to do sidebar and if you click, it navs to that part of the page? (ex: skills, exp, about me and when user clicks, it brings them there)
