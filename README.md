We are out here looking prettier!

Not super crazy about color scheme but I also do not have any other pics of myself aha
    if you choose to change, use unsplash


messing around with a parallax website. Need to add skills, experience, (basically break down resume.)


Also maybe see if there is a way to do sidebar and if you click, it navs to that part of the page? (ex: skills, exp, about me and when user clicks, it brings them there)

Look at board ideas -- split box into two colors, change overall fonts to a Google one
