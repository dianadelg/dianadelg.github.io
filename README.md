NEW: need to fix experience, typing layout on mobile (why aren't tiles working on chrome?)

We are out here looking prettier!

messing around with a parallax website. Need to add skills, experience, (basically break down resume.)
- for the experience -- reactive boi?
- still figuring out best way to display skills aha its Kyle do you not like my idea aha replytweet

Also maybe see if there is a way to do sidebar and if you click, it navs to that part of the page? (ex: skills, exp, about me and when user clicks, it brings them there) KYLE: aha if you actaully want this boi i can do it but you have to tell me where you want it.

QUESTION: should I add a link (little button boi) to my resume as well? (NOTE: UPDATE RESUME, it's ugly; add personal logo)
KYLE: aha its up to you, but if you already have ur experience on there, then the resume is meh BUT ITS UP TO YOU AHA


ignore parallax folder! it's old
ard bet
