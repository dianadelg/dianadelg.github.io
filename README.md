NEW: need to fix experience, typing layout on mobile (why aren't tiles working on chrome?)

We are out here looking prettier!

messing around with a parallax website. Need to add skills, experience, (basically break down resume.)
- for the experience -- reactive boi?
- still figuring out best way to display skills 

Also maybe see if there is a way to do sidebar and if you click, it navs to that part of the page? (ex: skills, exp, about me and when user clicks, it brings them there)

QUESTION: should I add a link (little button boi) to my resume as well? (NOTE: UPDATE RESUME, it's ugly; add personal logo)


ignore parallax folder! it's old
