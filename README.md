# dianadelg.github.io - parallax

messing around with a parallax website. Need to add typing text still in first bubble, about me, skills, experience, (basically break down resume.)

Add icons for connecting -- github, linkedin, insta

Also maybe see if there is a way to do sidebar and if you click, it navs to that part of the page? (ex: skills, exp, about me and when user clicks, it brings them there)
