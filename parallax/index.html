      <p>I am a current senior at Rutgers University - New Brunswick majoring in  <span class = "wordemp">computer science</span>  and minoring in  <span class = "wordemp">  psychology </span>through the School of Arts and Science Honors Program. 
        My goal is to work towards making innovative and efficient changes in the tech industry, while integrating properties of psychology; essentially, I want
        to <span class = "wordemp">make the tech world more humanistic</span> and <span class = "wordemp">ease the human world into a more technical one.</span> Merging these two fields is my passion, and I believe this can successfully be done through
        a deep understanding of both seemingly opposite disciplies. I'm also passionate about <span class="wordemp">closing the gender gap in S.T.E.M.</span> and increasing the involvement of minorities in computer science and software engineering.

         I'm also a member of the <span class = "wordemp">Psi Chi</span>, the national psychology honor society, and <span class = "wordemp">Google's Women Techmakers</span>. In my spare time, I'm either scrolling endlessly through Pinterest, watching super cheesy romance movies, or trying to replicate makeup I see on celebrities. </p>

    <h2>How Parallax Works</h2>
    <p>Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, including humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis. In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, and there is a device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range, and in some variations also altitude to a target.</p>

      <p>Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.</p>
