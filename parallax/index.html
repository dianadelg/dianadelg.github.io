          My goal is to work towards making innovative and efficient changes in the tech industry, while integrating properties of psychology; essentially, I want
          to <span class = "wordemp">make the tech world more humanistic</span> and <span class = "wordemp">ease the human world into a more technical one.</span> Merging these two fields is my passion, and I believe this can successfully be done through
          a deep understanding of both seemingly opposite disciplines.

    <div class="diana">Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, including humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis. In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, and there is a device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range, and in some variations also altitude to a target.</div>
